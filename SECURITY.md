### Authentication & Authorization

- **Secure Login**: Company code + email + password authentication
- **Session Management**: Secure session tokens with expiration
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permissions system
- **Password Security**: Secure password hashing (when implemented)

### Data Protection

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Prepared statements for all database queries
- **XSS Protection**: Output encoding and CSP headers
- **CSRF Protection**: CSRF tokens for state-changing operations

### Infrastructure Security

- **HTTPS Only**: All communications encrypted in transit
- **Cloudflare Security**: DDoS protection and WAF
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data in environment variables
- **Database Security**: D1 database with access controls

### Code Security
